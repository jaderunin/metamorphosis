# Description:

Download the encrypted flag `here`.
# Solution:
Encrypted Flag is:xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_555957n3}
I checked the number of shifts by comparing K of KBN with C of CTF. The shift is 18 alphabets so I ran echo "xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_555957n3}" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'S-ZA-Rs-za-r'
And it worked
# Flag:
picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_555957f3}
