# Description:
The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?
# Hints:
XML external entity Injection
# Solution:
Naturally, first thing I did was look around using inspect. I went through the index.html file and a line of code had POST mentioned. On googling, I figured that Post meant sending a post request to send data from a client to a server.
