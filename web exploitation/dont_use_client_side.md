Can you break into this super secure portal? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29835/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:29835
# Hint:

Never trust the client
# Solution: 
I opened the challenge site, which had a simple password form. The idea was to enter the right password and click "Verify Password." Knowing the hint, "never trust the client," I inspected the page using the developer tools. When I checked the JavaScript code, I found something interestingâ€”the password check was happening entirely on the client side, which is super insecure. Instead of sending the password to a server to verify, the code was comparing parts of the input directly to hardcoded values. 

Looking through the JavaScript, I saw that the password was split into multiple parts, each stored in the code itself. The substrings were `"pico"`, `"CTF{"`, `"lien"`, `"ts_p"`, `"lz_7"`, `"no_c"`, `"723c"`, and `"e}"`. 

Once I had all the pieces, I joined them together: `"pico" + "CTF{" + "lien" + "ts_p" + "lz_7" + "no_c" + "723c" + "e}"`
