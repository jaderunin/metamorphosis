# Description 
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/

# Procedure
Typed in the given prompt (snickerdoodle) which gives us 
> That is a cookie! Not very special though...
Then I used the inspect page to look around to see if the flag was provided anywhere (oasisCTF flashbacks). While looking around I realised I could just check the cookies. I noticed it had a value of 0, I kept incrementing until 18 which then lead to the flag.

# Learnings: 
I forgot to refresh the page after changing the values and was very confused and only realised what I'd done (or hadn't done) once i got to 32. ToT

# Flag
> picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}
