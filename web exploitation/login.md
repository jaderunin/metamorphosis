# Solution:


Opened the index.js file. we can see that the code is checking if the username and password provided by the user match a predetermined value.

The code uses the !== operator to validate the username and password entered by the user. First, it checks if t.u(username) is not equal to "YWRtaW4", and if incorrect, it displays an alert saying "Incorrect Username." If the username is correct, it then checks if t.p (password) is not equal to "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ", and if incorrect, it displays "Incorrect Password." If both are correct, it displays "Correct Password! Your flag is" followed by the decoded value of t.p using the atob() function. Since "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" is a Base64-encoded string, decoding it reveals the flag.
