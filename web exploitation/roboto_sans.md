# Description :
The challenge involves finding a flag hidden somewhere in a web application, but not necessarily on the website itself.

# Solution:  
The name of the challenge led me to check the `robots.txt` file, as itâ€™s commonly used to direct web crawlers on which pages to visit.

I retrieved the `robots.txt` file using `curl`, and found several base64 encoded strings.

Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

After decoding these strings, I discovered two possible file locations for the flag:

- `flag1.txt`
- `js/myfile.txt`

I tried accessing `flag1.txt`, but it returned a 404 error. However, when I accessed `js/myfile.txt`, I found the flag.
