# Description
Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag? Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

# Procedure 
Start from the web root directory (/usr/share/nginx/html/).
Use ../../../../ to traverse up four directories to reach the root (/).
Append flag.txt to the relative path.
Submit the input to retrieve the flag.
