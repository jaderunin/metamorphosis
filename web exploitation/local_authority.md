# Description:
The challenge asks you to find the flag by investigating a web application. You're required to determine how the password is checked on the website.

# Solution:
When I visited the website, I right-clicked and selected 'View page source' to check for anything related to the password. The HTML revealed a form for logging in with a username and password, which gets POSTed to `login.php` for verification.

Next, I accessed the `login.php` file by viewing its source code. It included a script called `secure.js`, which contained a function `checkPassword(username, password)` that checks if the username is 'admin' and the password is 'strongPassword098765'. 

After discovering the correct credentials, I returned to the main login page, entered the username 'admin' and password 'strongPassword098765', and successfully obtained the flag.
