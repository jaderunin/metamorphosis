from the description i knew that the flag was hidden in the source code so naturally I started inspecting the website and searching for keywords like "flag" or "pico" in the javascript files and html but didn't find anything.
I looked at the hint, so I understood that I need to use search tool to find the flag in the code source
so I did the next steps :
 1. wget -r http://saturn.picoctf.net:57523/

 this for pulling the code for the website

 2. grep -r pico *

 for search recursively for a "pico" in every file in the code source

Which lead me to:

 scc/style.css:/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49} **/


# flag:
> picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49}
