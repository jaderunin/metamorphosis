# Description:

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594



# Hint:

Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?
 # Solution:

The above link leads you to the factory login page, where you have to enter your username and password in order to sign in.

Tried entering the site with “logon” as the username and “Joe password, but unfortunately, it didn't work. there was a message: 
>”I’m sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way."

I looked at the hint and realised that I’m actually lacking so hard rn. Literally only Joe needs a password. So obviously I mindlessly entered admin and admin as the user-pw combo and I managed to log in and enter the site.
But when I logged in I still didn't see any flag, I saw this message:
> Success: You logged in! Not sure you’ll be be able to see the flag though.

So I had to find a way to expose the flag. If it doesn't work only with the signing in, maybe it is related to some cookie of the website. So I inspected the website, and looked at the cookies list:

I noticed that there is a cookie named "admin" and guessed that this cookie indicates whether the username that is logged in to the site has admin permissions. The initial value of the "admin" cookie was "False", so I tried changing it to "True" in order to get the admin permissions and get the flag.
