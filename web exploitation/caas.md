Now presenting cowsay as a service


# Solution: 

I entered the link: https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message} And I added the message "Hello world", I saw that there is no content that hints at the key,
So I used ls to see all the files and noticed a file called "falg.txt" which is similar to flag. The I obviously used cat to open the text file.
Uh
??????
