Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/
# Hints

1. It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
# Solution


When I visited the site, it says
> Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site so I ended up using Postman's HTTP request. Guess Iâ€™ll just unhide requests and override the default User-Agent request with a PicoBrowser agent. 

## Another Site

> I don't trust users visiting from another site.
Now, we need to make the header show it's from the same site. So I used a key of Referer with a value of the site (http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/)
## Only worked in 2018

> Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.
Used the Date header with any value from 2018, for example "1 Jan 2018"
## Trackable Means Untrustable

> I don't trust users who can be tracked.
We can set DNT which is "do not track" to 1 (true).
## Sweden

> This website is only for people from Sweden.
On googling I found out about X-Forwarded-For which will change the originating IP address. Grab any random IP address from Sweden like 12.16.66.01
## Speak Swedish

> You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?
We can use the Accept-Language header to specify which languages are ok. We can look through a list of languages and find Sweden's subtag is sv.

This made me LOSE my mind but its finally over. (literally lost my flag w all my excitement but I'll do it again to get it unfortunately it's gonna be a new instance tho)
