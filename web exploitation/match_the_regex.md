Match the Regex

# Description:

How about trying to match a regular expression (The challenge opens up as an instance)

# Hints:

1. Access the webpage and try to match the regular expression associated with the text field
# Solution:

The instance link brings you to a basic Html page where it says "Valid Input" and has an input box under 

First I used the inspect element tool and looked at the HTML code. I noticed there was a script tag there, I opened it and saw a fetch request to a server. In the script there was a weird comment "^p.....F!?", it reminded me to analyse the REGEX so I tried to match it in the input.
** three billion hours later**
I gave up and asked a friend for help. She just sent me a sticker of pizza in return.

so i tried "pizzaaF!" and submitted the answer.
