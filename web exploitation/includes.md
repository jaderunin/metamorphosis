Can you retrieve the flag? Visit this website and see what you can uncover.

# Hints:

- Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

# Solution:

The link leads to a basic HTML page that explains the concept of "includes." There's also a button labeled "say hello."



I started by reading the explanation about includes. Then, I clicked the "say hello" button, which triggered an alert saying the code was in a separate file.
   
I opened the browser’s inspector and navigated to the "Sources" tab. There, I found three files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`.

I reviewed the `script.js` file and discovered a function called `greetings` that triggers the alert with the message. Under the function, there was a commented line with the text `f7w_2of2_df589022`.

then checked the `style.css` file, where I found part of the flag. The flag wasn’t fully visible, and the alert mentioned that the code was split across multiple files. Since the flag was labeled "1 of 2," I inferred that the second part of the flag was in the commented line of the JavaScript file.

Combining both parts, I got the full flag.
