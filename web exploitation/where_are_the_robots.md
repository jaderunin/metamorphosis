# Description: 

Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

# Hints:

1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?
# Solution:

The above link brings you to a basic Html page where it says 
> welcome where are the robots? 

First I looked for hints in the page source, nothing. Then, I looked in sources, nothing.
Great.
I looked at the hint after this and realised that I needed to append /robots.txt (my dumbass kept entering robot instead of robots for SO long that I got a migraine) I appended robots.txt and it showed me the following text: 
> User-agent: * > Disallow: /1bb4c.html
  On appended /1bb4c.html to the url I got the flag. 
# Flag:
> picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}
